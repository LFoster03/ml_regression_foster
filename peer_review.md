1. Clarity & Organization (Is the notebook structured and easy to follow?)
   - Brenda Fuemmeler's notebook was well laid out. The steps are easy to follow. I liked that the notebook started with a question as the objective: 'Can we predict fuel efficiency based on engine specs and weight?' 
   - I also like how missing data is handled. It is ordered as Fix 1 and Fix 2. 
   - I noticed that some of the sections where questions are answered, the question and the answer aren't split up. Everything is bolded. Instead, it may look better to have the question bolded and the answer italicized or the answer placed below the question. Doing either of these things may help the formatting of the notebook.
   
2. Feature Selection & Justification (Do the chosen features make sense given the objectives?)
   - MPG as fuel efficiency, and then weight, displacement, cylinders and horsepower to determine best mpg makes sense as this shows which cars perform best. 
   - It is mentioned that displacement, cylinders and horsepower could be combined into 1 variable, but research did not recommend that option. I am not sure why it would not be recommended except maybe because you would get better results from using them all separately? I wish this was explained further. 

3. Model Performance & Comparisons (Are the results and comparisons clearly explained?)
   - The results and comparisons are clearly explained as Pipeline 2: Polynomial Deg=3 performed the best with R² as 78%, and lowering the 3-4 mpg range to 2.6-3.4 instead. 
   - It would be interesting to see some charts visualizing these comparisons. 

4. Reflection Quality (Are insights well thought out?)
    - The insight summary showed how much was learned throughout this project and how much more experiementation that could be had with this dataset. 
    - I would have liked to see some visualizations of each of the models to provide more insight into how each model differed in results. We could have seen exactly why pipeline 2 was better compared to the other two.
    - Overall, I enjoyed this notebook and enjoyed learning a bit more about fuel efficiency in cars and how someone might use this data when buying a car.
